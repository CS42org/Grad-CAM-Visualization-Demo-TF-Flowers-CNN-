# Grad-CAM-Visualization-Demo-TF-Flowers-CNN-
This project demonstrates how to apply Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with the TensorFlow Flowers dataset. It highlights which image regions influenced the model’s prediction — making deep learning more interpretable and explainable.

The notebook includes:

1. Loading and resizing the TF-Flowers dataset (5 classes)
2. Building and training a simple CNN model
3. Computing Grad-CAM heatmaps
4. Visualizing the focus areas overlayed on test images

Designed for students, educators, and developers learning Explainable AI (XAI).
