# Grad-CAM-Visualization-Demo-TF-Flowers-CNN-
This project demonstrates how to apply Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with the TensorFlow Flowers dataset. It highlights which image regions influenced the model’s prediction — making deep learning more interpretable and explainable.
